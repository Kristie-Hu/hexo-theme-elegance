# Hexo-Theme-Elegance
> Ported Theme of [Hux Blog](http://huangxuan.me/). Thank [Huxpro](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io) for designing such a flawless theme.
> 
> Theme Elegance was created by [Kristie-Hu](https://github.com/Kristie-Hu) on the basis of previous ported versions by [Kaijun](https://github.com/Kaijun/hexo-theme-huxblog) (the original Porter), [Yu Hsuan Yen](https://github.com/YenYuHsuan/hexo-theme-beantech) and [V-Vincen (Vincent)](https://github.com/V-Vincen/hexo-theme-livemylife) respectively. (A big thank-you to everyone ❤).   
> This ported theme features an one-off installation of `git clone` *to the theme folder* rather than overwriting the entire hexo blog.

### WARNING :exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation:: This theme is still under construction, install at your own risk.
> This theme was originally ported from Jekyll using Bootstrap, a front-end language I am not yet familiar with.   
> I have therefore, sought to personalize the theme (adding features like additional navigation tabs within the home page)   
> But as I am relatively new to the front-end language, I struggle  to understand how the theme works, trying hard to enbed a page, but to no avail.   
> Under current circumstances, this theme works just fine, though the style will need further improvement.   
> Any help will be appreciated!
> 
> Though it seems difficult (and intimidating as well) to someone who do not code regularly, I promise I will not abandon this project, and find the solution at the earliest time possible.

> _**Stay Tuned.**_
