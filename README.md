# Hexo-Theme-Elegance
> Ported Theme of [Hux Blog](http://huangxuan.me/). Thank [Huxpro](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io) for designing such a flawless theme.
> 
> This Elegance theme was created by [Kriestie-Hu](https://github.com/Kristie-Hu) based on multiple ported themes by [Kaijun](https://github.com/Kaijun/hexo-theme-huxblog)(the original Porter), [Yu Hsuan Yen](https://github.com/YenYuHsuan/hexo-theme-beantech) and [V-Vincen (Vincent)](https://github.com/YenYuHsuan/hexo-theme-beantech) respectively, but simplified its installation to just `git clone`.
