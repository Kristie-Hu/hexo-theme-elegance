# Hexo-Theme-Elegance
> Ported Theme of [Hux Blog](http://huangxuan.me/). Thank [Huxpro](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io) for designing such a flawless theme.
> 
> This Elegance theme was created by [Kriestie-Hu](https://github.com/Kristie-Hu) based on multiple ported themes by [Kaijun](https://github.com/Kaijun/hexo-theme-huxblog)(the original Porter), [Yu Hsuan Yen](https://github.com/YenYuHsuan/hexo-theme-beantech) and [V-Vincen (Vincent)](https://github.com/YenYuHsuan/hexo-theme-beantech) respectively, with simplified installation of one-time `git clone`.

### WARNING :exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation:: This theme is still under construction, although it's perfectly fine to install.
> This is a ported theme from Jekyll using bootstrap as its framework, on which I have little knowledge.
> 
> I have thus far attempted to add more navigation pages (e.g. about & archives) within the theme, but unsucceeded.
> 
> I will keep working on this project, and post the update at my earliest convenience.
