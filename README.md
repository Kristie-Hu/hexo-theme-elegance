# Hexo-Theme-Elegance
> Ported Theme of [Hux Blog](http://huangxuan.me/). Thank [Huxpro](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io) for designing such a flawless theme.
> 
> Theme Elegance was created by [Kristie-Hu](https://github.com/Kristie-Hu) on the basis of previous ported versions by [Kaijun](https://github.com/Kaijun/hexo-theme-huxblog) (the original Porter), [Yu Hsuan Yen](https://github.com/YenYuHsuan/hexo-theme-beantech) and [V-Vincen (Vincent)](https://github.com/V-Vincen/hexo-theme-livemylife) respectively. (A big thank-you to everyone ❤). This ported theme features an one-off installation rather than overwrite the entire hexo blog.

### WARNING :exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation:: This theme is still under construction, install at your own risk.
> This theme was originally ported from Jekyll using bootstrap, a front-end language I am not yet familiar with.
> 
> This theme works just fine under current situation, but I'd like to add some more navigation tabs, such as about and archives and make a little tweaks on the overall style. 
> However, my knowledge is still not sufficient enough for me to do so. Any help is WELCOME!
> But I promise I will stick to this project, and work out the mystery ASAP.
