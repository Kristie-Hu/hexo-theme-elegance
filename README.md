# Hexo-Theme-Elegance
> Ported Theme of [Hux Blog](http://huangxuan.me/). Thank [Huxpro](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io) for designing such a flawless theme.
> 
> This Elegance theme was created by [Kristie-Hu](https://github.com/Kristie-Hu) based on multiple ported themes by [Kaijun](https://github.com/Kaijun/hexo-theme-huxblog)(the original Porter), [Yu Hsuan Yen](https://github.com/YenYuHsuan/hexo-theme-beantech) and [V-Vincen (Vincent)](https://github.com/YenYuHsuan/hexo-theme-beantech) respectively (thank everyone for that ❤) , but simplified with easier installation of `git clone`.

### WARNING :exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation:: This theme is still under construction, although it's perfectly fine to install.
> This theme was originally ported from Jekyll using bootstrap, a front-end language that I have little knowledge about.
> 
> This theme works just fine under current situation, but I'd like to add more embedded navigation pages (i.e. about & archives) within the homepage, but I still haven't worked out yet.
> 
> I will keep working at it, and hopefully solve this mystery.

> _**Stay Tuned.**_
