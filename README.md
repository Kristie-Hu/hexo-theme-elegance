# Hexo-Theme-Elegance
> Ported Theme of [Hux Blog](http://huangxuan.me/). Thank [Huxpro](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io) for designing such a flawless theme.
> 
> Theme Elegance was created by [Kristie-Hu](https://github.com/Kristie-Hu) on the basis of previous ported versions by [Kaijun](https://github.com/Kaijun/hexo-theme-huxblog) (the original Porter), [Yu Hsuan Yen](https://github.com/YenYuHsuan/hexo-theme-beantech) and [V-Vincen (Vincent)](https://github.com/V-Vincen/hexo-theme-livemylife) respectively. (A big thank-you to everyone ❤).   
> This ported theme features an one-off installation of `git clone` *to the theme folder* rather than overwriting the entire hexo blog.
> 

### WARNING :exclamation: :exclamation: :exclamation:: This theme is still under construction, install at your own risk.
> This theme was originally ported from Jekyll using Bootstrap, a front-end language I am not yet familiar about.
> 
> I have attempted to make several tweaks: adding some more navigation tabs within the home page, but to my current knowledge, I find no answer.   
> Although fairly speaking, this theme works just fine under current situation, the style of the theme is still to be improved. Help will be appreciated!
> 
> But I promise I will always be committed to this project, and find the solution at the earliest time possible.

> _**Stay Tuned.**_
